Organizations commonly require that all APIs be fronted by an API Gateway [including the Apollo Router](/technotes/TN0037-api-gateways).
These API Gateways often are not configured by default to send multipart HTTP requests chunks as they are available which leads to unexpected behavior when using [subscriptions over HTTP Multipart](/router/executing-operations/subscription-support#http-callback-setup).

To allow HTTP multipart subscriptions to work correctly, the API Gateway must send the response as it comes and not buffer the response.

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

## Azure API Management (APIM)

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

By default, an HTTP API endpoint setup in APIM buffers the response from a downstream service. What this means is that it will "wait" to receive all the chunks from the HTTP request before returning it to the client.

To enable HTTP subscriptions, the `forward-request` policy on the `backend` should be updated with `buffer-response="false"`. This will result in the endpoint sending the chunks to the requesting client as they are received.

```xml
<policies>
    <backend>
        <forward-request http-version="2or1" buffer-response="false" />
    </backend>
</policies>
```

## Google Apigee

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

By default, an HTTP API endpoint in Apigee buffers the response from a downstream service. What this means is that it will "wait" to receive all the chunks from the HTTP request before returning it to the client.

To enable HTTP subscriptions, the `response.streaming.enabled` property should be set to `true` in both your `ProxyEndpoint` and `TargetEndpoint` definitions in the proxy bundle. This will result in the endpoint sending the chunks to the requesting client as they are received.

```xml
<TargetEndpoint name="default">
  <HTTPTargetConnection>
    <URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</URL>
    <Properties>
      <Property name="response.streaming.enabled">true</Property>
    </Properties>
  </HTTPTargetConnection>
</TargetEndpoint>
```

```xml
<ProxyEndpoint name="default">
  <HTTPProxyConnection>
    <BasePath>/v1/weather</BasePath>
    <Properties>
      <Property name="response.streaming.enabled">true</Property>
    </Properties>
  </HTTPProxyConnection>
</ProxyEndpoint>
```

## Mulesoft

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

### Flex Gateway

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

Streaming of HTTP multipart is supported out of the box with no additional configuration required.

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

### Proxy (Mule 4, CloudHub 2.0)

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

Streaming is not supported and it is recommended to use a Flex Gateway.

## Kong

Streaming of HTTP multipart is supported out of the box with no additional configuration required.

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

## AWS API Gateway

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

At this time, AWS API Gateway does not support streaming of HTTP data. An possible workaround is to use a Lambda expression which does support streaming.
